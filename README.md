# Chirply

**Chirply** is a federated, Twitter-inspired microblogging platform powered by a custom-built HTTP API written in vanilla Java. It demonstrates core web concepts such as HTTP routing, JSON handling, and RESTful API design â€” without relying on external frameworks.

This project uses the `javax.json-1.1.4.jar` library for JSON parsing.

## How to Run the Server

1. Go into the desired part e.g. `cd part1` for Part1
2. Make the shell script executable by running the command

```bash
chmod +x run_server.sh
```
3. Run the Server by executing the shell script

```bash
./run_server.sh

```
The script compiles the Java files with the needed JSON libraries and starts the sevrer

**Thank you for the practical!**
